# Tourist-Guide

Description: This program generates graphs and finds articulation vertices (cut vertices) within the graphs, which are vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. It was written in Java using the Eclipse IDE using linked lists and hash sets.

This algorithm creates a graph by reading in a number, which is the number of vertices to be created, followed by a newline character. It then reads in that same number of names for each of the vertices, each of which are followed by a newline character. After generating the vertices, it reads in a second number, which is the number of edges to be created, followed by a newline character. Following this, it reads in pairs of vertex names, each of which are followed by a newline character, to determine edges within the graph. Once the graph exists, the algorithm determines which of the vertices within the graph are articulation vertices (cut vertices). It will continue to run until the number of vertices is zero, at which point the program exits.
